    <h1>Studying the Correlation between Tweet Sentiment and Stock Prices</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to explore the relationship between public sentiment on Twitter and stock market movements. By analyzing tweet sentiments and their potential impact on stock prices, the project seeks to uncover meaningful correlations that could help in predictive market analysis.</p>

## Technical Details 
The technical aspects of the project "Studying the Correlation between Tweet Sentiment and Stock Prices" involve a blend of data acquisition, natural language processing (NLP), and statistical analysis. Tweets are collected in real-time using Twitter APIs, while stock data is sourced from financial market APIs. The project employs Python libraries like Tweepy for data collection and Pandas for data manipulation. Sentiment analysis of tweets is executed using NLP tools such as NLTK or TextBlob, which assign sentiment scores to the text data. These scores are then statistically analyzed alongside stock price fluctuations to identify potential correlations. This in-depth analysis is crucial for understanding the impact of public sentiment on the financial markets facilitating interactive data exploration and visualization.
